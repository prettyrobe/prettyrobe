<p> <center> <font color = "black" face = "cambria"> <b> I am Robe-Ann S. Calumpang, a licensed professional teacher. I have a burning passion<br>
to share my knowledge and experiences. I completed my Bachelor of Elementary<br>
Education with major in Content Education degree in 2018 as Cum Laude.<br><br>

Before graduating college, I was able to participate and join in different clubs<br>
and organizations in our university where I got the chance to practice my leadership<br>
and academic skills. I joined different organizations and joined school competitions<br>
as to hone my craft as an upcoming teacher.<br><br>

With the desire to train and expose myself early to the challenges of being an educator,<br>
I also applied as a substitute teacher for a public school, an institution that provides<br>
quality primary lessons to students who are interested in learning and achieving lifelong goals.<br>
I stayed in the institution for a year and ended my term with a grateful heart.<br> 
Experience has taught me how to build strong relationships with any departments<br> 
at an organization. I have the ability to work within a team as well as cross-team. </font color = "black" face = "cambria"> </b><br></b><br>
